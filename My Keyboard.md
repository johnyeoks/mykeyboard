*My bad I apologise, do allow me to restart*
<br/><br/>
*Ahem* You are walking down the aisle of whereever, you walk past a normal, average and nothing-outstanding guy, you gave absolute zero fucks except you know the fact that he is of Asian heritage through the eyes, real eyes realise real lies, just kidding he has monolid and slanted eyes.
